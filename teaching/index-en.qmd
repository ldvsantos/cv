## {{< fa chalkboard-user >}} Teaching

I work as a **Visiting Professor** at the [Graduate Program in Territorial Planning](https://www.uefs.br/) at the State University of Feira de Santana (UEFS), teaching courses related to my research areas.

Previously, I served as a volunteer professor at the Federal Institute of Sergipe (IFS, São Cristóvão Campus, 2021 to 2023) and as a visiting professor at the Agrotechnical State School of Jeremoabo (2011 to 2012).

## {{< fa people-group >}} Supervision

I supervise undergraduate theses, master's dissertations and doctoral theses in sustainable agriculture and nature-based solutions systems, soil, water and biodiversity conservation, intellectual property with emphasis on technological prospection and patentometry, sustainable innovation articulated with entrepreneurship and technology transfer, as well as territorial planning with a focus on productive systems optimization.

## {{< fa clipboard-check >}} Expectations for Students

Students are expected to develop high-quality work, grounded in relevant scientific literature and with appropriate methodology. The literature review must be comprehensive and up-to-date, clearly identifying research gaps that justify the proposed work. The methodological approach must be rigorous and reproducible, ensuring that results are presented scientifically and subject to external validation.
