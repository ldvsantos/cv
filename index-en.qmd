## {{< fa user >}} About me

I am an **Agricultural Engineer** (UFS) and hold a **PhD in Intellectual Property and Innovation** (UFS, 2023), with emphasis on sustainable agroforestry commercialization. I am currently a Visiting Professor at the Graduate Program in Territorial Planning at the [State University of Feira de Santana (UEFS)](https://www.uefs.br/) and a researcher at the Incubator for Popular and Solidarity Economy Initiatives (UEFS).

I lead the **PLANeT-Inova** group (Territorial Planning, *Nature-Based Solutions* and Sustainable Innovation) and participate in the Research Groups on Hydroenvironmental Management of the Lower São Francisco River and on Soil Management and Sustainability, both affiliated with UFS.

I co-founded the Academic League for Sustainable Agriculture **(L-AGROS)** and the Unit for Technology Diffusion and Innovation in Soil and Water Conservation **(UDTI)**.
